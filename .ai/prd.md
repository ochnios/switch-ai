# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - switch-ai (MVP)

## 1. Product Overview

switch-ai is a chat application designed for advanced Large Language Model (LLM) users who require greater flexibility and control over their conversations. In the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version, the application focuses on solving two key problems: the inability to seamlessly switch between different AI models within a single conversation, and the difficulty in exploring alternative threads without losing context.

The product offers a single, fluid interface that allows users to select an AI model for each message sent and to create new, independent conversation threads (branching) based on the full history or an automatically generated summary. The application is aimed at "power users," operates on a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model with OpenRouter integration, and prioritizes functionality and workflow efficiency.

## 2. User Problem

Users of standard chat interfaces with LLMs encounter two fundamental limitations that hinder their productivity and creativity:

1. Lack of flexibility in model selection: Different AI models specialize in different tasks (e.g., creative writing, code analysis, logical reasoning). To leverage these specializations, users are forced to work in multiple browser windows, manually copying and pasting conversation context, which is time-consuming, inconvenient, and leads to fragmented work.
2. Linearity of conversations: Current interfaces impose a linear conversation flow. Exploring alternative ideas, asking tangential questions, or testing different scenarios within the same context is difficult. Users must either "clutter" the main thread, leading to chaos, or start a new conversation from scratch, losing all previous history.

switch-ai addresses these problems by creating an integrated environment for dynamic and contextual management of interactions with multiple AI models.

## 3. Functional Requirements

* FR-01: User Authentication: The system will allow users to create an account and log in to store and access their conversation history.
* FR-02: API Key Management (BYOK): Users must be able to securely enter and save their own OpenRouter API key. The key must be stored encrypted on the server side and never exposed on the client side.
* FR-03: Chat Interface: The application will provide a simple and clear interface for conducting text conversations with AI models.
* FR-04: Per-message Model Switching: For each message input field, the user will have the option to select an AI model from a list. The list will include the most popular OpenRouter models and a search function.
* FR-05: Conversation Management: Users will have access to a list of their historical conversations. The application will allow creating new conversations, switching between existing ones, and permanently deleting them.
* FR-06: Conversation Branching: Each message (both user and assistant) in a conversation will have an option to create a new, independent conversation in two modes:
  * FR-06a: Full History: A new conversation is created as an exact copy of the entire history up to that point.
  * FR-06b: Summary Thread: The application automatically generates a summary of the conversation up to that point, which becomes the first system message in the new thread.
* FR-07: Automatic Conversation Naming: Newly created conversations will automatically receive a title (2-4 words) based on the content of the first message. Branched conversations will be named according to the scheme `[Parent Conversation Title] - branch X`.
* FR-08: Token Counter: An estimated token counter for the current conversation will be visible in the user interface, updated after each new message.
* FR-09: Remembering Last Model: The application will remember the last used AI model in the browser's `localStorage` and set it as the default for the next message or a new conversation.
* FR-10: API Error Handling: Errors returned by the OpenRouter API will be displayed as a message in the chat window, without blocking the interface and allowing the user to continue working.
