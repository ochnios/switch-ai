## Project Description

**switch-ai** is a chat application designed for advanced Large Language Model (LLM) users who require greater flexibility and control over their conversations. The application focuses on solving two key problems: the inability to seamlessly switch between different AI models within a single conversation, and the difficulty in exploring alternative threads without losing context.

The product offers a single, fluid interface that allows users to select an AI model for each message sent and to create new, independent conversation threads (branching). The application is aimed at "power users," operates on a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model with OpenRouter integration, and prioritizes functionality and workflow efficiency.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

* Astro 5
* React 19
* TypeScript 5
* Tailwind CSS 4
* Shadcn/ui

**Backend:**

* Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data storage and authentication
* AI integration via OpenRouter.ai API

**CI/CD / Deployment:**

* GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
* DigitalOcean for hosting using Docker images

## Getting Started Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ochnios/switch-ai.git
   cd switch-ai
   ```

2. **Ensure you are using the correct Node version:**

## Project Scope

The project is currently focused on delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the core functionalities.

### In Scope for MVP:

* **User Authentication**: Simple user authentication (email/password).
* **API Key Management (BYOK)**: Securely save an OpenRouter API key.
* **Chat Interface**: A clean interface for text conversations.
* **Per-message Model Switching**: Select an AI model for each message from a searchable list.
* **Conversation Management**: Create, switch between, and delete conversations.
* **Conversation Branching**: Create new conversation threads from any message, either with the full history or from a generated summary.
* **Automatic Conversation Naming**: New conversations are automatically named based on the first message.
* **Token Counter**: Display an estimated token count for the current conversation.

### Out of Scope for MVP:

* Complex conversation visualization (e.g., a tree format).
* File attachments (images, documents).
* Assistant response streaming.
* Web search integration.
* Sharing and exporting conversations.
* Handling multiple conversations simultaneously in one view.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the MVP stage and under active development.
